## Blackjack Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Blackjack** card game. The objective of the game is to get as close as possible to a card value of 21 without exceeding it, using a standard deck of cards. Players can "hit" to draw cards or "stand" to keep their current hand.

## Three Cup Monte Game

A simulation of the **Three Cup Monte** street game. In this game, the player must guess under which cup a ball is hidden after the cups are shuffled.

## Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game that can be played between two players in the terminal. The game alternates between Player 1 ("X") and Player 2 ("O").

## War Card Game

A **War Card Game** implementation in Python where two players compete by drawing cards from their decks. The player with the higher card value wins the round. If thereâ€™s a tie, a "war" occurs where additional cards are drawn.

## Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

This section contains examples of web scraping using **BeautifulSoup** to extract data from websites. These scripts demonstrate how to interact with HTML and extract useful information such as titles, links, images and text.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (BeautifulSoup, requests, etc.)

### Dependencies:
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `random` (for games)
- `time` (for game delays)

You can install all dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

### Notes:
- You can improve or extend each of these projects as you wish.
- Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you encounter bugs or have ideas for new features.
